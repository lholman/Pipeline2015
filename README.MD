###Brief Synopsis (c. 100 words):###
To provide attendees with an insight in to a real life example of applying well known product management, agile and DevOps principles to realise Continuous Delivery, that is, the ability to always be able to deploy. 

###Talk Details:###
####Set the scene####
*Timing - 0-3 mins*
*Purpose:* Explain who I am, what this talk is about and what I mean by product management, Continuous Delivery (CD) and Agile principles i.e. a more personal synopsis

* Intro: I'm Lloyd, I'm a freelance software engineer, I believe in #DevOps principles and strive to Continuously Deliver everything (even this talk..see https://github.com/Pipeline2015/Talk.MD). I've worked in many sectors including manufacturing, consultancy and eCommerce in support, operational, development and more recently (last 6 years) in a release/build/devops/consultancy capacity. 

* Continuous Delivery:  The CXX test, always capable of deploying. Strong Continuous Integration (CI) with visible notifications and high quality output tested automatically. Deployment automation and configuration management governance. Fail ideas early, get to market before the competition and realise Return on Investment (RoI) quickly.

* Agile: I believe in the agile manifesto and many of the Scrum/Kanban/Xanban/XP principles and applying them to ones organisation. That said, the single most important point is I believe an organisation being truly agile means they actively encourage failing early and efficiency and strive to reduce release batch sizes, these are, for me at least key for enabling Continuous Delivery. 

* Product Management: #NoProjects, let's think in the context of products by making our process, tooling and infrastructure first class citizens. Make code (app or infrastructure) build, integrate and deployable from the first line.

####Continuous Delivery maturity assessment####
*Timing - 4-8 mins*

*Purpose:* Provide a concrete assessment of a team/organisations current capability to continuously deliver.  
* Introduce the maturity model, practices and maturity levels
* Tasks 
  * Perform a high-level assessment against all practices in the Continuous Delivery book maturity model. Ensure that all team members/stakeholders have input 
* Output
  * Simple, a dated and highlighted Continuous Delivery maturity model.
  * Broadcast and share this internally, scan it and email it, digitize it and add it to source control if you can.

####Identify the pain points####
*Timing - 9-14 mins*

* Questions to ask of the filled out maturity model assessment 
  * Where are you regressive and not repeatable?
  * If you were to move up a level in a practice, which would offer the highest business value?
* Road-mapping
  * Using the GO Product Roadmap 
* Low hanging fruit vs significant wins
* Manual vs automation
* Process improvement
* Applying agile principles
  * Story writing, satisfy client and business requirements, not just tasks 

* What next?
  * Additional practices, e.g. "Disaster Recovery"
